Ad Campaign Performance Analytics Dashboard

 Project Summary 

This project demonstrates my ability to analyze real-world digital advertising data and translate it into clear business insights and strategic recommendations.
Using simulated Facebook/Instagram Ads data, I evaluated campaign effectiveness, identified performance gaps, and built an interactive Power BI dashboard to support data-driven marketing decisions.

Key focus areas:

Campaign performance evaluation

Audience and demographic analysis

Cost efficiency and ROI optimization

Business-focused storytelling with data

Business Problem

Marketing teams often invest heavily in ad campaigns without clear visibility into:

Which campaigns actually drive conversions

Where budget is being wasted

Which audience segments perform best

This dashboard answers these questions by converting raw ad data into actionable insights for decision-makers.
